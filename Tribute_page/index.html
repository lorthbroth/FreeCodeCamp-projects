        <h2>A brief history of: <q>OR</q> Tambo:</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Tambo was born on 27 October 1917 in the village of Nkantolo in Bizana in eastern Pondoland in what is now the Eastern Cape.</li>
          <li> He attended Anglican and Methodist missionary schools, including Holy Cross missionary school with his brother in April 1928. After 5 years at the Holy Cross, Tambo excelled in his studies and transferred to St. Peter's in Johannesburg. Tambo
            graduated in 1938 as one of the top students. After this, Tambo was admitted to the University of Fort Hare but in 1940 he, along with several others including Nelson Mandela, was expelled for participating in a student strike. In 1942, Tambo
            returned to his former high school in Johannesburg to teach science and mathematics</li>
          <li>In 1943, Tambo, Mandela and Walter Sisulu founded the ANC Youth League, with Tambo becoming its first National Secretary and a member of the National Executive in 1948</li>
          <li>In 1955, Tambo became Secretary-general of the ANC after Sisulu was banned by the South African government under the Suppression of Communism Act. In 1958, he became Deputy President of the ANC and in 1959 was served with a five-year banning
            order by the government</li>
          <li>In response, Tambo was sent abroad by the ANC to mobilise opposition to apartheid. He settled with his family in Muswell Hill, north London, where he lived until 1990. His exile took a toll on him seeing his wife and three children, but his
            wife Adelaide supported the ANC at home by taking in ANC members arriving in the UK</li>
          <li>He returned to South Africa on 13 December 1990 after over 30 years in exile,after having been elected National Chairperson of the ANC in July of the same year.</li>
          <li>When returned after his time in exile he was received lots of support. Some of that support even came from old rivals. However, because of his stroke in 1989. </li>
          <li>On the morning of the 24th April 1993, Oliver Reginald Tambo passed away after suffering a fatal heart attack. His epitaph, reads, in his own words:<br>
            <q>It is our responsibility to break down barriers of division and create a country where there will be neither Whites nor Blacks, just South Africans, free and united in diversity</q></li>
